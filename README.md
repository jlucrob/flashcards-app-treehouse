# flashcards-app-treehouse
Flashcard study app, as taught by Treehouse in the "Express Basics" course (https://teamtreehouse.com/library/express-basics-2)

Using Express, Mongoose, Pug and DB on MongoDB Atlas.

Notes: 

Most of the code was done during the course "Express Basics" course on Treehouse.

Here are some of the features that I added, that were not covered in the course:

- All the flashcards are saved to a MongoDB on MongoDB Atlas

- Multiple Flashcards topic and the ability to switch between them

- Ability to add or delete flashcards topics (the entire /edit-cards page)

- Keeping track of which cards have been "already seen" using cookies

- Randomizing the order in which cards appear
